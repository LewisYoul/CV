## Lewis Youl

Current student at Makers Academy, one of the worlds most selective web development bootcamps. I bring the analytical thinking and attention to detail required during my career in science into the code that I write. I am looking to immerse myself in the development community, contributing to the continued progression and development of web technologies.

## Skills

#### Attention to Detail

An absolute requirement in my four years as a Labortory Scientist to ensure accurate, reliable results and successful procedures that can be utilised by others. Specifically pipetting extremely small volumes on a daily basis, the microscopic manipulation of mouse embryos and surgical transplant of these embryos; resulting in a high number of successful pregnancies.

#### Proactive

Consistently looking for projects to work on and ways to improve, will actively contact others to collaborate and increase my knowledge. In previous employment at The Francis Crick Institute I concieved, developed and implemented a service for tracking the microbial gut populations of laboratory mice through gene sequencing. This required a significant amount of self-study and collaboration with resident bioinformaticians.
